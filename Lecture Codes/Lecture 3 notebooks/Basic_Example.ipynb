    "# Stack\n",
    "A ***stack*** is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the ***last-in, first-out (LIFO)*** principle. A user may insert objects into a stack at any time, but may only access or remove the most recently inserted object that remains (at the so-called “top” of the stack). The name “stack” is derived from the metaphor of a stack of plates in a spring-loaded, cafeteria plate dispenser. In this case, the fundamental operations involve the “pushing” and “popping” of plates on the stack. When we need a new plate from the dispenser, we “pop” the top plate off the stack, and when we add a plate, we “push” it down on the stack to become the new top plate. Perhaps an even more amusing example is a PEZ® candy dispenser, which stores mint candies in a spring-loaded container that “pops” out the topmost candy in the stack when the top of the dispenser is lifted (see Figure 6.1). Stacks are a fundamental data structure. They are used in many applications, including the following.\n",

    "Stacks are the simplest of all data structures, yet they are also among the most important. They are used in a host of different applications, and as a tool for many more sophisticated data structures and algorithms.

    "Another fundamental data structure is the ***queue***. It is a close “cousin” of the stack, as a queue is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the ***first-in, first-out (FIFO)*** principle. That is, elements can be inserted at any time, but only the element that has been in the queue the longest can be next removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually say that elements enter a queue at the back and are removed from the front. A metaphor for this terminology is a line of people waiting to get on an amusement park ride. People waiting for such a ride enter at the back of the line and get on the ride from the front of the line. There are many other applications of queues (see Figure 6.4). Stores, theaters, reservation centers, and other similar services typically process customer requests according to the FIFO principle. A queue would therefore be a logical choice for a data structure to handle calls to a customer service center, or a wait-list at a restaurant. FIFO queues are also used by many computing devices, such as a networked printer, or a Web server responding to requests.\n",
