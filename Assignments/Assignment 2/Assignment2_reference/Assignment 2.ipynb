    "If the collection C to be sorted is implemented by means of an array-based sequence, most notably as a Python list, we can speed up heap-sort and reduce its space requirement by a constant factor using a portion of the list itself to store the heap, thus avoiding the use of an auxiliary heap data structure. This is accomplished by modifying the algorithm as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We redefine the heap operations to be a maximum-oriented heap, with each position’s key being at least as large as its children. This can be done by recoding the algorithm, or by adjusting the notion of keys to be negatively oriented. At any time during the execution of the algorithm, we use the left portion of C, up to a certain index i−1, to store the entries of the heap, and the right portion of C, from index i to n−1, to store the elements of the sequence. Thus, the first i elements of C (at indices 0, . . . , i−1) provide the array-list representation of the heap.\n",
    "1. In the first phase of the algorithm, we start with an empty heap and move the boundary between the heap and the sequence from left to right, one step at a time. In step i, for i = 1, . . . ,n, we expand the heap by adding the element at index i−1.\n",
    "1. In the second phase of the algorithm, we start with an empty sequence and move the boundary between the heap and the sequence from right to left, one step at a time. At step i, for i = 1, . . . ,n, we remove a maximum element from the heap and store it at index n−i.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In general, we say that a sorting algorithm is ***in-place*** if it uses only a small amount of memory in addition to the sequence storing the objects to be sorted. The variation of heap-sort above qualifies as in-place; instead of transferring elementsout of the sequence and then back in, we simply rearrange them. We illustrate the second phase of in-place heap-sort in the following figure.\n",
